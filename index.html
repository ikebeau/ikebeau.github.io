        <p>
          I started my schooling in 2022 studying at BYU-I. Since then, I have built several projects,
          lead data science teams, worked for cooperations such as Country Supplier and BYU-I. My goal
          is to provide people and businesses with the insights to make data driven decisions. I do this
          through utilizing statistics, and predictive modeling.
